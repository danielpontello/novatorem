# Spotireadme

This is a modified version of [Novatorem's GitHub Spotify profile](https://github.com/novatorem/novatorem), to match the style of my GitHub README file. It shows the current playing music in an retro-OS style.

I do not recommend using this repository as-is; the resulting SVG file is huge and most of it was hand-edited to work, so things can break at any moment!
